    "text": "Research staff at the Lake Superior Reserve operate the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) on the St. Louis River Estuary in Superior, WI. SWMP provides researchers, resource managers, educators, and coastal decision makers a standardized network of water quality, weather, and nutrient data measures. We initiated SWMP in 2012 and continue to grow the program to monitor change, and evaluate how coastal ecosystems are responding to climate change. SWMP is happening along our coasts in a network of 30 National Estuarine Research Reserves. You can find out more information and download SWMP data at the Centralized Database Management Office.\nTake a look at where we collect water quality, weather, and nutrient data in the St. Louis River Estuary.\n\nupdated: February 26, 2023"
